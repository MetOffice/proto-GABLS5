# proto-GABLS5

This repository contains code and doumentation for the GABLS5 project.
Large data files (such as netCDF) should NOT be comitted to this repository.

GABLS5 is a project within GEWEX, https://www-gewex.org, sponsored by the
GLASS panel. GABLS5 builds on the work of earlier GEWEX projects (GABLS1 
to GABLS4 and DICE) to improve the parametrization of the atmospheric boundary
layer and its interaction with the land surface. The focus of the project
is exploitation of the data collected at the GEWEX Land-Atmosphere Feedback
Laboratories (GLAFO). Initial studies will be based on observations from the
site at Hohenheim, but the intention is to establish a methodology that can be
extended to future GLAFO sites around the world.

Cases for intercomparison will include both single-column models and 
high-resolution regional and large-eddy models.

This repository will contain:
   * Descriptions of the cases.
   * Documentation.
   * Example scripts to obtain the data from public sources, such as the
     Copernicus archive and the archived GLAFO data.
   * Scripts to assist in the postprocessing and reduction of the output from
     simulations for submission to the intercomparison.

A suitable repository for the main diagnostic files for the project has yet
to be identified, though some data may be placed on www.zenodo.org, but this
repository is not suitable for those files.
